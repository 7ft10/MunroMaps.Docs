### Learning Milestones

The trick is to replace these somewhat opaque eng/UX milestones with _learning milestones_, each producing a somewhat more evolved version of the product that is then immediately tested with an ever larger group of users for a longer period of time. What’s learned is then fed back to the team and is used to decide what to build in the next milestone — an opportunity to update the spec or to pivot. The team is instructed to only focus on the next milestone and not to rush for the final launch.

> The goal of the team is to learn by putting an ever more complete version of product in front of an increasingly larger group of users for longer durations.
