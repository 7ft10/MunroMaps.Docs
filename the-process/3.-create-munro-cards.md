# 3. Create Munro cards

Identify the journey elements 

* Once you have identified your destination and your rationale you can then brainstorm ways and means to achieve the outcome
* Don’t look at it linearly – just identify the elements that need to be in place
* Start with Nouns - List the names of all the things that need to be touched / influenced / changed by the journey
* Verbs are the key - Bloom’s Taxonomy Action Verbs

Create your Munro Cards!

* Initiative Name -&gt; Verb + Noun
* What products / platforms / channels are involved?
* What team might work on it?
* Known constraints?
* Known personas involved?
* Known deadlines?

* **Ideas** are constantly collected and prioritized. We never stop looking for new ideas.
* **Step-projects** are defined at the beginning of the quarter. The team picks the goals and ideas it wishes to pursue this quarter, and defines step-projects accordingly. The quarterly step-project list \(typically stored in a spreadsheet or database tool\) is evaluated and reprioritized every 1–2 weeks, in sync with task iterations planing.



* Short sub-quarter step-projects rather than long multi-quarter/multi-year projects.
* No betting on just a few big ideas that take forever to implement — we test many ideas quickly and pursue the ones that work.
* Iterations — we revisit every part of the plan regularly and systematically and stay agile at all levels.

### **Takeaways**

#### **1. Stop investing in bad ideas**

This example illustrates how risky it is to bet on a high-effort features based on gut-feelings, opinions, themes, market trends, etc. Most ideas are more like the chatbot than they are like the dashboard — they underdeliver on impact and cost much more than we think. The only real way to find winning ideas is to put them to the test and reduce the level of uncertainty.

#### **2. Worry about outcomes, not output**

This may seem like a laborious and slow way to build products, but it’s actually much more efficient than the alternatives. Not only does confidence testing eliminate most of the wasted effort spent on bad ideas, it also focuses the team on short and tangible [learning milestones](https://blog.itnig.net/optimizing-your-project-for-learning-dfb60e86fd09) with immediate measurable results, which improves focus and velocity. Through the process we learn a lot about the product, users, market, and end up with better end-product that has already been tested by users. We are therefore rarely surprised at launch day and need to make far fewer fixes post-launch.

#### **3. Let a thousand flowers bloom**

In reality we often need to choose not between two ideas, but between dozens. By limiting the effort we put into each idea based on our level of confidence in it, we allow ourselves to test many ideas in parallel, avoiding the pitfalls of traditional big-bet development— see my post on [GIST planning](https://hackernoon.com/why-i-stopped-using-product-roadmaps-and-switched-to-gist-planning-3b7f54e271d1) for more on this.

In this example the team is testing 4 ideas in parallel by running several step-projects, each incrementally building a bigger version of the idea and testing it for higher confidence.

#### **4. Get your managers and stakeholders on board**

Here’s what worries people most when I explain this topic — how to get mangers and stakeholders to buy-in? Can we really get them to limit their god-like powers over the product? Well, you’d be surprised. I hear a lot from managers that they prefer not to be the deciders on product matters, but they feel compelled to get involved as the team is presenting them with weak options. What is weak or strong is of course subject to opinion, unless you show up to the review not just with a polished pitch deck, but with real evidence and clear confidence levels. You might be surprised how much easier the conversation gets. On the flip side, the next time your CEO surprises you with a new must-have pet idea, try to show her how her idea is evaluated— how much impact, effort and confidence we can give it, how its ICE scores stacks up against other ideas, and how we can test to gain more confidence. Most reasonable folks will agree that that’s a good way to go about it. If they’re still not convinced, send this blog post to read and asked them to leave a comment \(or message me @ItamarGilad\), and I promise to fight the good fight on your behalf.
