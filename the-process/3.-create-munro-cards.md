# 3. Create Munro cards

Identify the journey elements

* Once you have identified your destination and your rationale you can then brainstorm ways and means to achieve the outcome
* Don’t look at it linearly – just identify the elements that need to be in place
* Start with Nouns - List the names of all the things that need to be touched / influenced / changed by the journey
* Verbs are the key - Bloom’s Taxonomy Action Verbs

Create your Munro Cards!

* Initiative Name -> Verb + Noun
* What products / platforms / channels are involved?
* What team might work on it?
* Known constraints?
* Known personas involved?
* Known deadlines?

## Tactics

What [tactics ](../the-mechanics/approach-and-strategy/strategy-vs-tactics.md)will you employ to achieve this initiative.

Tactics can be seen as was to complete the challenge (see: [https://melissaperri.com/blog/2016/07/14/what-is-good-product-strategy](https://melissaperri.com/blog/2016/07/14/what-is-good-product-strategy)). The format presented by Melissa Perri is good:

> In order to reach our vision, we need \<measureable objective> by \<time frame>.

Where time frame is initially long, example: In order to reach our vision, we need to decrease the feedback cycle of regression tests results where it is over 5 days to less then 20 min by X date. And then shorter when looking at the next target condition, the next initiative, example: In order to reach our next target condition, we need to reduce regression testing of critical business process X to 5 minutes and can be automatically triggered any time of day.

* **Ideas** are constantly collected and prioritized. We never stop looking for new ideas.
* **Step-projects** are defined at the beginning of the quarter. The team picks the goals and ideas it wishes to pursue this quarter, and defines step-projects accordingly. The quarterly step-project list (typically stored in a spreadsheet or database tool) is evaluated and reprioritized every 1–2 weeks, in sync with task iterations planing.
* Short sub-quarter step-projects rather than long multi-quarter/multi-year projects.
* No betting on just a few big ideas that take forever to implement — we test many ideas quickly and pursue the ones that work.
* Iterations — we revisit every part of the plan regularly and systematically and stay agile at all levels.
