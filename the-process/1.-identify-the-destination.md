# 1. Identify the destination

Intent Thinking – goal based

For a current piece of work, think about a strategic goal \(1, 3, or 5 year\) that would be appropriate for that piece of work?

SMART Goals need to be defined \(Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time bound\)

Identify the “Primary goal” and the “Secondary / Sub- goals” \(if required\)
