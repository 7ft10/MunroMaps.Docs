# Strategy vs Tactics

### Strategy - Tactic Difference in Military Usage

Militaries often make a distinction between strategy and tactics. Strategy involves planning, during war and peace times, preparing for the unexpected for greater security and future victory. Tactics, on the other hand, deals with carrying out the objectives laid out in strategy â€” i.e., accurately and efficiently deploying troops and military equipment to combat zones.
