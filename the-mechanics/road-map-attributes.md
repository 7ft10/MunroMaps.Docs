# Road Map Attributes

**Guides** “Something that serves to direct or indicate.”

·         Metrics and reporting – like user stories, a project is either done or not done.

**Routes / Approaches** “A way or course taken in getting from a starting point to a destination.”

·         Principles help us make the right decisions or approach to a situation, routes are the way we order things.

**Way-points** “An intermediate point on a route, a stopping point or point at which course is changed”

·         Way-points are reporting frequency and big room planning sessions allowing for us to pivot as required. Can also be ad-hoc.

**Risk Analysis** “The process of identifying and analysing potential issues that could negatively impact the journey.”

·         Market analysis, product and project risk analysis including resourcing, budget, skills, knowledge, etc.

**Destination Point** “The place to which someone or something is going”

·         The Goal of the road map – you may pass through other places of interest along the way, but there is only 1 destination, 1 goal.

**Starting Point** “A place that marks the beginning of a journey.”

·         The current state: running projects, budget, current products in the market, competitors.

**Key Milestones** “A signal indicating the distance in from or to a given point.”

·         May signal anchors such as a project end/start, external or budget reviews, etc. In many instances, milestones do not impact project duration. Instead, they focus on major progress points that must be reached to achieve success.
