# Approach & Strategy

Reactionary – acknowledge and respond, preserve the status quo/fight to survive

Remedial – understand and conform, avoid dumb stuff and do more and better of the same

Resourceful – identify and capitalise on assets, maximise natural opportunities and work in the “white spaces”

Revolutionary – create and exploit, change the rules, control the game-board, innovate



The next step on the journey is to figure out what ways you could go on the journey – how you are going to get there

This is key to strategic thinking and allows you to understand the options associated with the journey you are undertaking
