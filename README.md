## Introduction to Munro Maps

Welcome to the Munro Maps wiki! This space is dedicated to exploring the innovative concept of Munro Maps, an agile tool designed to create meaningful and useful road maps for teams navigating the complexities of product development and project management.

#### What is a Munro Map?

A Munro Map serves as a flexible, dynamic guide, allowing teams to chart their journey from the **"Now House"** (the starting point) to their **summit goal** (the desired destination). Unlike traditional road maps that often constrain teams with rigid timelines and feature lists, Munro Maps embrace agility, adapting to new information and insights as they emerge.

#### Key Features of Munro Maps

Munro Maps stand apart from conventional road mapping techniques in several important ways:

* **Non-linear Planning**: They do not conform to the waterfall model or create Gantt charts, instead favouring a more fluid representation of progress that respects the dynamic nature of agile environments.
* **Focus on Initiatives**: Munro Maps use directed graphs to represent various initiatives (the **nodes**) and their dependencies, providing a clear visual overview of how these elements interact and contribute to the overall project goals.
* **Collaboration and Communication**: Emphasising the importance of collaboration, Munro Maps promote teamwork and communication, ensuring that all team members are engaged and contributing to the road map's evolution.
* **Adaptable to Change**: They act as a living document that can be updated and adjusted based on ongoing feedback and new developments, maintaining relevance throughout the project lifecycle.

#### The Mountain Analogy

The Munro Map metaphorically aligns the product journey with climbing a mountain. Starting at the base camp, teams face various **milestones** and decisions as they progress towards their summit. Just as climbers assess their route and adapt to conditions, teams can adjust their strategies based on the latest data, feedback, and insights. This approach cultivates a sense of urgency and direction, motivating teams to reach their goals while remaining agile in their tactics.

#### Benefits of Using Munro Maps

Research and presentations from various conferences and workshops indicate that using Munro Maps leads to outcomes that far exceed those of traditional road mapping techniques. Teams can create detailed road maps quickly through collaborative efforts, embracing the agile principle of prioritising individuals and interactions over rigid processes and tools. Time remains an important aspect of planning; however, it is viewed as relative and fluid, enabling teams to stay focused on achieving their objectives without being constrained by fixed timelines.
